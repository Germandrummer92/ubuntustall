# Ubuntustall

Small utility bash script I hacked together after managing to completely fry my Partition Table the other day and having 
reinstall every tool and setting up configs for a day I decided to script the entire thing.

Includes Installation of my most used tools and configs for my home as well as work setup.

Currently installed tools:

* [Yakuake](https://www.kde.org/applications/system/yakuake/) (Also changes Config to not use the default KDE Browser when 
clicking Links, see)
* [Oracle JDK PPA]()
